Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at Institute for AI Research, Tsinghua University. Before that, I received my Ph.D. from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in June 2022 (Supervisors: [Prof. Shangguang Wang](https://sguangwang.com)). I received my B.S. in communication engineering from BUPT in 2016.
